  "projectExperience": "This project was an excellent experience to learn new technologies like Chakra UI, React-Query, and it was also the first time I created an interface for a blockchain application. I have a few years of experience in the field (4+), working primarily with React. However, I had little experience with Next.js, and this project was fantastic for deepening my understanding. I had a lot of fun during the process, even though some features are still missing (like asset deletion and test coverage, for example).",
